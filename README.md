# Visualizing Seattle Traffic Collisions 2022-2023

Map Application Link: [Insert Link Here]

Navigating the intricate web of Seattle's streets involves a delicate balance of vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. Prioritizing safety in this dynamic environment requires a comprehensive understanding of car collision patterns. To address this need, we present an interactive map showcasing vehicle collisions across the greater Seattle area from March 2022 to December 2023. The map features a thematic heatmap illustrating the frequency of injuries resulting from these collisions. Users can utilize a slider to explore collision data within specified date ranges, offering insights into the evolving patterns throughout the year.

### Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide a visual representation designed to educate and inform both the general public and government officials about the occurrence and frequency of traffic collisions in the city. The visualization identifies high-risk areas, offering valuable insights to the local community and enhancing awareness among pedestrians navigating these neighborhoods. For government agencies such as the Seattle Department of Transportation and Sound Transit, this information is instrumental in driving targeted improvements and implementing changes in areas prone to frequent collisions. This map could be a key tool utilized in future planning to strive toward making the streets a safer place for everyone.

### Data Source
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the Seattle Department of Transportation, a municipal agency dedicated to planning, designing, and maintaining the city's transportation infrastructure. Specifically, the dataset reflects the locations of collisions based on Seattle traffic police reports. While the original dataset contained comprehensive collision information, our focus narrowed to the scale of collisions, the number of injuries sustained, and pedestrian involvement. To streamline and enhance our dataset, we selected a subset covering the past year and eliminated irrelevant columns to optimize the size of our geoJson file.

### Technology Utilized
The key application library powering our project is the Mapbox GL JS library. This technology empowers us to create interactive maps and visualizations, providing an engaging platform for users to explore and comprehend the dynamics of traffic collisions in Seattle. Leveraging this advanced library, we ensure a seamless and informative user experience, allowing for a deeper understanding of the data presented.

### Importance and Impact
Beyond its technical aspects, the project's significance lies in its potential to contribute to public safety and urban planning. By shedding light on the spatial distribution of traffic collisions, the map serves as a tool for proactive decision-making. It enables civic engagement by informing residents about safety concerns in their neighborhoods and empowers government officials to enact targeted interventions. Through this collaborative approach, we strive to foster a safer and more informed community.
